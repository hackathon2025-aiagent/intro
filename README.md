## About

This repository contains the main homepage implementation for our **HackBay 2025** team project. 

We are building **TaskHub** - a marketplace for task-specific AI agents that helps enterprises create specialized AI configurations for different development workflows.

## Project Overview

- **Event**: HackBay 2025 Hackathon
- **Team Organization**: [@hackathon2025-aiagent](https://github.com/hackathon2025-aiagent)
- **Purpose**: Enterprise AI task marketplace and CLI tool
- **Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript + Material-UI + Storybook

## What We're Building

TaskHub solves the enterprise AI problem where adding more rules actually makes AI agents dumber. Instead of one confused AI, we create specialized agents for specific tasks:

- 🤖 **Task-Specific AI Agents** - Expert agents for compliance, documentation, testing, etc.
- 🛠️ **CLI Integration** - Simple commands to load, export, and manage AI configurations  
- ⚡ **Instant Setup** - From 30 minutes to 30 seconds for specialized AI
